# User Stories for Simple Notes App
This activity will help you practice building full-stack applications with CRUD functionality. You will be implementing a simple notes app that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. The app will have a homepage to display a list of notes, a form to add new notes, and individual note details pages for viewing and editing notes. You can complete it using your `first-next-template`. It is done when you have implemented all the user stories and acceptance criteria.
